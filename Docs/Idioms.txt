Decided
- State machines over coroutines
- Locate objects by reference
- Group objects by reference
- Mouse selection handled in input manager
- Central input handling (classes register functions to input manager)

TODO
D - Coroutines vs. state machines.
- Nested prefabs vs. linked prefabs vs. god prefabs.
- Data separation strategies.
- Ways of using sprites for states in 2D games.
- Prefab structure.
- Spawning strategies.
D - Ways to locate objects: by type vs. name vs. tag vs. layer vs. reference ("links").
D - Ways to group objects: by type vs. name vs. tag vs. layer vs. arrays of references ("links").
- Ways to call methods on other components.
- Finding groups of objects versus self-registration.
- Controlling execution order (Using Unity's execution order setup versus yield logic versus Awake / Start and Update / Late Update reliance versus manual methods versus any-order architecture).
D - Selecting objects / positions / targets with the mouse in-game: selection manager versus local self-management.
- Keeping data between scene changes: through PlayerPrefs, or objects that are not Destroyed when a new scene is loaded.
- Ways of combining (blending, adding and layering) animation.
D - Input handling (central vs. local)
